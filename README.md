/* Udacity Blogsite Project*/
This file serves as the HTML ref for my Udacity blogsite project. I am also using this file for ongoing storage of my literary pieces poems etc. 

Not looking for contributions but comments welcome. Using this as an archive for my personal work, possibly to go live in the future. If you have any input on coding practices and common mistakes that beginner programmers make--please feel free to enlighten me! I love learning new tips/tricks! 

xoxo
